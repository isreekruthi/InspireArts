# InspireArts
**An Educational Website for Children's Art and Music Lessons**

InspireArts is a fully static website built using HTML5 and CSS3. The site is designed to help parents of young children (ages 2–12) explore personalized art and music instruction options. It provides an engaging, intuitive experience for discovering services, scheduling lessons, and submitting creative work.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a platform for a music teacher to promote their business and connect with potential clients and parents. Drawing on years of experience teaching violin and singing throughout high school, I am passionate about bringing art to local communities and fostering growth and learning for young artists.
